## Git Console

If you're not using any sort of Git Interface software like SourceTree, you have to do Git commands from the command line.

For example, to commit, you need to run something like:

```
git commit -a -c "This is a commit with a commit message"
```

Files can be added selectively or `-a` can be used to commit changes to all files.

More information on Git commands can be found at <https://git-scm.com/docs/>
